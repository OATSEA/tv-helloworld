<title>Teacher Virus Hello World Payload</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>This is an example of a basic Teacher Virus payload.</p>
<p>All it takes to create a working payload (our word for apps that run on the TV platform) is at least an index.html (or index.php) file in the root of a GitHub repository.</p>
<p>You should also include an icon.png (or icon.svg) file to become the button image for your payload</p>
<p>GitHub will suggest (and we agree) that you also create README.md file to explain your payload - and an open source license file (Apache 2.0 please).</p>
