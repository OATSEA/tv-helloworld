<title>Teacher Virus Hello World Payload</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>This is an example of a basic Teacher Virus (TV) payload.  You can see what it's made up of at its GitHub repository:  <a href="https://github.com/harrylongworth/tv-helloworld">github.com/harrylongworth/tv-helloworld</a></p>
<p>To create your own first payload why don't you fork this payload and give it a go? You'll then be able to install your forked version by simply entering in your GitHub username and the name you give the forked repository.</p>
<p>However - if you want to start from scratch; all it takes to create a working payload (our word for apps that run on the TV platform) is at least an index.html (or index.php) file in the root of a GitHub repository.</p>
<p>You should also include an icon.png (or icon.svg) file to become the button image for your payload.  If you don't provide an image TV will use the default OATSEA logo image (which this payload uses)</p>
<p>GitHub will suggest (and we agree) that you also create a README.md file to explain your payload - and an open source license file (Apache 2.0 please).</p>
